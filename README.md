# Webcam and Audio Visualizer with Noise Suppression

This project allows users to access their webcam and microphone, visualize audio levels using a canvas, and enable or disable noise suppression for better audio clarity. The video stream from the webcam is displayed, and the audio levels are visualized in real-time. Additionally, users can enable noise suppression via a checkbox to reduce background noise.
