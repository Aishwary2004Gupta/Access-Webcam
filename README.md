# Webcam and Audio Visualizer with Noise Suppression

This project allows users to access their webcam and microphone, visualize audio levels using a canvas, and enable or disable noise suppression for better audio clarity. The video stream from the webcam is displayed, and the audio levels are visualized in real-time. Additionally, users can enable noise suppression via a checkbox to reduce background noise.

## Features

- **Webcam Access**: Streams the user's webcam video to the screen.
- **Audio Visualizer**: Displays a real-time audio visualizer (bars) of the microphone input.
- **Noise Suppression**: Users can toggle noise suppression for clearer audio.
